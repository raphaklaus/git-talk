# Pure Git Rebase

Syntax: git rebase <base_branch>

## What happens behind the scenes?

* Git repo is checkout to `base_branch` at `HEAD`
* Git calculates what commits doesn't exist in `base_branch` that you have made in the topic one
* Apply commits from previous step on the tip of the checked branch
* If any problem, conflicts will tell!

## Profit!
