# Git Rebase --onto (2 args)

Don't let the strange syntax complicate on you.

## git rebase --onto F D
`Read like: Starting from D, rebase all on top of F`

```
          Before                           After
    A---B---C---F---G (branch)        A---B---C---F---G (branch)
             \                                     \
              D---E---H---I (HEAD)                  E---H---I (HEAD)
```

Instead of automatically get the due commits and apply them on top of the branch, get all commits after D and apply on top of F.
