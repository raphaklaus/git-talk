# Why conflicts happen? :S
**Stop fearing the unknown!**

* When pulling from upstream and you receive changes in the same lines of your local changes.
* When rebasing interactively and you remove/edit a commit that the upcoming commits depends on and make them incompatible
* When merging/rebasing/cherrying-picking and git brings the **full snapshot** from other branch, when you wanted just the changed lines.
