# Why conflicts happen? :S

**Stop fearing the unknown!**

* When pulling from upstream and you receive changes in the same lines of your local changes.
* When rebasing interactively and you remove/edit a commit that the next commits depends on and make them incompatible
* When cherrying-picking and git brings the **full snapshot** from other branch, when you wanted just the changed lines
* When rebasing and your commit's diff don't match anymore with the new base
