# Squashing

Imagine you have written a new feature that demanded you 90 commits in a topic branch.

You want that to be preserved for historical and documenting reasons yet the person reading the base branch is not really interested on HOW but WHAT.

# What happens when you press that "Squash and Merge" button on GitHub?

`$ (master) git merge topic --squash`

This is what is run behind the scenes.
