# Merging

### No Fast-Forward (Recursive)

* It re-creates each commit from the topic branch on the tip of the base branch
* At the end, it creates a "Merge commit" with two parents
* This type of merge is performed by GitHub when you click "Merge Pull Request"
* You end up with branches on your Git log

`$ (master) git merge topic --no-ff`
