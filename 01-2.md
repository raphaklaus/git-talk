# Merging

Integrate changes into. Happens for for both `git merge` and `git pull`

### Fast-Forward

**Important: Only happens when the base has no new commits!**

* Not always possible!
* base HEAD pointer "fast-forward" to the last commit in the topic branch
* Linear Git history
* Commit hash keep the same

`$ (master) git merge topic`
