# Rebase in Git Pull

Both integration actions (merge and rebase) works for `git pull` commands.

So you can pull into your local copy like this: `git pull --rebase`

## Advantage?

It depends on the flow you are working with. But if the topic branch is a long-lived one, maybe it is interesting because it doesn't create the merge commit all the time there is something new.
